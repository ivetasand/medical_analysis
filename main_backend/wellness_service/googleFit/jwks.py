# Python script to create JWKS public and private keys.
# Can be used when creating an Okta Oauth application.
# Requires https://github.com/latchset/jwcrypto
# https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/implement-oauth-for-okta-serviceapp/main/
# Warning: These key are being produced for automation which doesn't work well when there are password protected keys.
# Private keys without passwords provide an extreme security risk and should be handled securely and always encrypted at rest after generation.
# Please move the keys created in the keys directory to a secure location for use ASAP.
